# Mastodon Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets for use browsing the Mastodon social network, including one for remote following

## Remote follow

The eventual intention is for this to be used for all follows, regardless of whether they are for the instance you are on, or not. Why? I can be browsing at instance foo.bar, where I have an account, but still want to use my bar.foo account to follow.

Update this bookmarklet to have your instance address instead of mastodon.technology. Highlight the @who@foo.bar account identifier and click the bookmarklet.

Create additional bookmarklets for each instance.

TODO:

* make it clickable from profile page w/ out having to highlight anything
* make it clickable for short account IDs (like @one instead of @one@two.three)
* ~~trim whitespace? double-click for highliting didn't work on profile page~~
* ~~MAKE IT USE https://mastodon.technology/authorize_follow?acct=arunsathiya%40mastodon.social (bookmarks dedicated to each account)~~
